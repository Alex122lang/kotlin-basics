### OOP (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)
Objects are standalone entities that have properties and methods

### why code in OOP
1. Faster and easier to execute
2. Provide a clear structure for the programs
3. Reduces redundancy (repetition)

### Pillars of oop
Classes and Objects
1. Classes : are the blueprints of how the objects will be created
2. Objects : are a class instance
3. Inheritance : a class can inherit props and methods from another class
4. Interfaces : contracts between classes
5. Data classes : these are simply classes that hold data i.e. not blueprints
6. Sealed classes: classes that restricts inheritance
7. Singletons: classes with methods to perform common functionalities
8. Access modifiers :: provides variables in classes with visibility control
- public (default)
- private
- protected
- internal (visible within the same module)
